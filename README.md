## Burrito
It is made with a savory filling, choice of meat such as chicken, beef, or pork, and  include a large array of other ingredients such as rice, cooked beans, vegetables, cheese, and other ingredents like salsa, guacamole **wrapped in a tortilla**.I like it as it has all the ingredients have their own **distinct flavors** and are well blended when wrapped so that each bite gives a taste of those flavors.

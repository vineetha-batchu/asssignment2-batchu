## Burrito
It is made with a savory filling, choice of meat such as chicken, beef, or pork, and  include a large array of other ingredients such as rice, cooked beans, vegetables, cheese, and other ingredents like salsa, guacamole **wrapped in a tortilla**.I like it as it has all the ingredients have their own **distinct flavors** and are well blended when wrapped so that each bite gives a taste of those flavors.

### Code Fencing
> C (/siː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
